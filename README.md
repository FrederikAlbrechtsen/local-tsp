# Local search TSP

Python implementation of heuristics for the TSP - greedy, also known as nearest neighbour (NN) and 2-opt.

The tour used for the TSP is: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Dallas, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, St. Louis, Houston, Phoenix, Salt Lake City. The NxN matrix is in miles.

## TSP
The traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a problem that deals with finding the shortest and most efficient route for a list of specific destinations. It is an NP-hard combinatorial problem, and consequently, no known polynomial-time algorithm can solve all instances of the problem.

Heuristic algorithms provide strong solutions, but not necessarily optimal.
